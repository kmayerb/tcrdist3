    """Tests for association of categorical variables in x_cols with the neighborhood
    around each TCR in clone_df. The neighborhood is defined by the K closest neighbors
    using pairwise distances in pwmat, or defined by a distance radius, knn_radius.

    Uses hierdiff package (available on PyPI) for tallying counts in each cluster
    and running tests.

    The statistical tests made available by this function are limited and meant only
    as a way to scan for signals. More sophisticated testing/modeling frameworks
    should be considered for real-world problems.

    Use test_method = None to return a table of counts for all neighborhoods that can be saved as
    a CSV and used to run other, more sophisticated tests (e.g. edgeR or other regressions).

    Use Fisher's exact test (test_method='fishers') to detect enrichment/association of the neighborhood
    with one binary variable. For example, test the 2 x 2 table for each clone:

    +----+----+-------+--------+
    |         |  Neighborhood  |
    |         +-------+--------+
    |         | MEM+  |   MEM- |
    +----+----+-------+--------+
    |VAR |  0 | a     |    b   |
    |    +----+-------+--------+
    |    |  1 | c     |    d   |
    +----+----+-------+--------+

    Use the chi-squared test (test='chi2') to detect association across multiple variables.
    Note that with sparse neighborhoods Chi-squared tests are unreliable.

    Use the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (test='chm') to test stratified 2 x 2 tables:
    one VAR vs. neighborhood, over several strata defined in other variables.
    Use x_cols[0] as the primary (binary) variable and other x_cols for the categorical
    strata-defining variables. This tests the overall null that OR = 1 for x_cols[0].
    A test is also performed for homogeneity of the ORs among the strata (Breslow-Day test).
